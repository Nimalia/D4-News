Hi, I'm **Alina** üëã

I 'm trying to become a developer . I'm trying to get into IT. 
It is a difficult path for me. But I'm not discouraged because **everything is possible** ü§ûüòâ

My main project is [NEWsPortal](http://127.0.0.1:8003/news/) at the moment.
Let me tell you about this project

Site structure:

I'll tell you more about the navigation buttons:

1. ![doc_pic](project/images/allNEWS.png)
   
    Click on this button and you will see list of news and articles. Sorting by date
2. ![doc_pic](project/images/search.png)

   You can find news by date, title, category.
   Look here:
   ![doc_pic](project/images/window of searching.png)


3. ![doc_pic](project/images/create.png)
   
   You can create your own news or articles! üéâ
   but it's available for only registered users.

   For Sing up you should press button:

   ![doc_pic](project/images/sign up:in.png)

   Complete this form:

   ![doc_pic](project/images/page of sign up.png)

   or if you are a registered user press [Sign IN](http://127.0.0.1:8003/accounts/login/)


4. ![doc_pic](project/images/scribers.png)

   –£ou can quickly subscribe to the categories of news and articles which you like by clicking on these buttons. 
   The buttons shared into categories.
   
   For example:

   ![doc_pic](project/images/example scribe.png)


So it's the main functionality of my project at the moment. 
I'm going to refine and improve this project.

```` Thank you! üôè ````
